# JavaScript Multiple-Choice Quiz Game

This project is a simple *MCQ (Multiple-Choice) Quiz Game* built entirely using *JavaScript*.  
The game runs inside the *browser console* and does not require any HTML or CSS.  
All the questions, options, and correct answers are stored in an array of objects.

## 📌 How the Quiz Works

1. The quiz questions are stored as an array of objects inside *quiz.js*  
   Each question contains:
   - the question text  
   - four options (A, B, C, D)  
   - the correct answer  

2. The user inputs A/B/C/D through prompt()  
3. Input is cleaned using:
   - trim() → removes spaces  
   - toLowerCase() → makes input case-insensitive  

4. The program checks the answer using an if/else condition  
5. Score increases for correct answers  
6. Final score is displayed using alert()
